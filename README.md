# Overview

As a software engineer trying to further my learning, I wanted to create a project that would help me understand inheritance and polymorphism in object-oriented programming. I decided to create a simple inventory system for a video game, where different types of items (offensive, defensive, and potions) would inherit from a base item class and have their own unique properties and methods. 

The inventory system allows players to add, remove, and view items in their inventory, as well as use items with unique functionality through polymorphism. At this stage, every Item "does" the same thing (prints to the console it's intended effect), but in the future, I plan to implement unique behaviors for each item type within a game context. The main.cpp file demonstrates how to create and manipulate these items in the inventory through a simple command-line interface. 

My purpose in writing this software was to solidify my understanding of inheritance and polymorphism, and to create a foundation for more complex game mechanics in the future. I intend to bring this inventory system into a larger game project written in the Godot game engine, where I can further explore these concepts in a more practical context.

# Future Work

Things I want to fix, add, or improve in the future include:
- Implement unique behaviors for each item type within a game context.
- Integrate the inventory system into a larger game project using the Godot game engine.
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user interaction.
- Expand the item types to include more properties and functionality
- Implement saving and loading of inventory data.
- Add unit tests to ensure code reliability and correctness.
- Optimize the code for better performance and memory management.
